Installing is as easy as setting an environment name and region for the install. SSL will be provisioned automatically for the environment and your install will be up and running after several  minutes. The installer dialog will provide the URL to finish setup.

We recommend after install to setup email on Mattermost to ensure you get proper notifications. We recommend [this guide](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/mailgun-setup) for configuring Mailgun with your domain for SMTP but there are several other services that offer similar functionality. You can access SMTP settings from the System Console under Environment > SMTP
